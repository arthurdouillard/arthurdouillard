Bonjour ! I'm arthur, a French coder / researcher / teacher / foodie.

1. Most of the code I do is available publicly on this github account.

2. I do research in Continual Learning, where I aim to train neural networks on continually growing amount of tasks, without forgetting. You can see my work on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=snwgZBIAAAAJ&hl=en) page. Don't hesitate to contact me to chat about that or to do colab'.

3. I'm the author of a free course on Deep Learning for Computer Vision --> [Deepcourse](https://arthurdouillard.com/deepcourse/)
You'll learn from the basics (backprop) to the latest research done in a wide variety of domains. Each topic has lessons, coding exercices (with hidden solutions), and Anki flashcards.

4. I'm french, of course I'm a foodie.
